        <p>
            My Favorite video game is called Doom 2016. Not only is it <strong style="color:red">awesome</strong>, but it is also <strong style="color:red">fun</strong> to play.
            I have been playing it for close to two years until its sequel, Doom Eternal, came out. The sequel is a lot more difficult than the original. But it doesn't take away from
            the experience of the adrenaline rush that both Doom games gives you.
        </p>
        <h3>Here is the back story of the main character:</h3>
        <p>
            "In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, 
            his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, 
            he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; 
            and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. 
            He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer."
